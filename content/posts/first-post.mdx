# Building Scalable AI Agents

In the rapidly evolving landscape of Artificial Intelligence, **Agentic Workflows** are becoming the new standard for automation. Unlike traditional linear automation scripts, AI Agents can reason, plan, and react to dynamic environments.

## Why Agents?

1. **Adaptability**: Agents can handle edge cases that break regex-based parsers.
2. **Tool Use**: They can interact with APIs, databases, and the file system.
3. **Memory**: Long-term memory vectors allow context retention across sessions.

## The Stack

For my recent projects, I've been heavily relying on:

- **LangGraph**: For defining cyclic graph-based flows.
- **CrewAI**: For role-based agent orchestration.
- **FastAPI**: To expose agents as microservices.

### Code Example

Here is a snippet showing a simple agent setup:

```python
from langchain.agents import initialize_agent, Tool
from langchain.llms import OpenAI

def search_tool(query):
    return "Search results for: " + query

tools = [
    Tool(
        name="Search",
        func=search_tool,
        description="Useful for answering questions about current events"
    )
]

# Initialize the agent
agent = initialize_agent(tools, llm, agent="zero-shot-react-description")
```

## Conclusion

The future of backend engineering is hybrid: classical deterministic systems for stability, and probabilistic AI agents for flexibility.
